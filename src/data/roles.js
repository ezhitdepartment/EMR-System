// data/navigation.js) each role can see/reach. "all" means unrestricted —
// currently only Admin. Add a new role's dashboard access here; Sidebar.jsx
// and AppRoutes.jsx both read from this so they can't drift apart.
// "labOrders" and "xrayOrders" are two SEPARATE sidebar tabs/pages (Lab
// Orders vs X-Ray Orders — see LabOrders.jsx / XRayOrders.jsx), even though
// under the hood they both read/write the same `lab_orders` /
// `lab_order_tests` tables, just scoped to a different set of diagnostic
// tests (Laboratory vs X-Ray/Ultrasound & Imaging — see FORM_TYPE_BY_TEST
// in utils/labOrders.js). A role can be granted one, the other, or both:
//   - med_tech only ever needs Laboratory results -> "labOrders" only.
//   - xray_tech only ever needs X-Ray/Ultrasound results -> "xrayOrders" only.
//   - everyone else who touches orders across both specialties (nurses,
//     cashier, admin) gets both, so nothing they created disappears from
//     view depending on which tab they happen to be on.
//
// NOTE: "xrayOrders" is a FRONTEND-ONLY distinction (which nav tab shows,
// which route a role can reach). It is intentionally NOT mirrored as its
// own row in the Supabase `role_feature_access` table — server-side RLS on
// lab_orders/lab_order_tests still checks the single 'labOrders' feature
// flag (see current_user_has_feature('labOrders') in the SQL schema) plus
// current_user_can_access_form_type() to scope which tests a tech role can
// see/edit. xray_tech already has a 'labOrders' row in that DB table from
// the original schema — leave it there; removing it would break xray_tech's
// actual data access even though their sidebar no longer shows a tab
// literally labeled "Lab Orders".
